        Lookup the Requests To Pay Resource (RequestsToPayId) using the x-idempotency-key.

        This is an alternative way for PISPs to obtain a RequestsToPayId where they did not receive any response body from the PASP (due to network error or timeout).

        If the current time window exceeds the Authorization Expiration Time Window (and the Consent status is AwaitingAuthorization) then the Consent Status must be set to Rejected.
        The time window is based on a custom time format hhh:mm:ss. e.g. 720:00:00 represents a time window of 720 hours, 00 minutes, 00 seconds (30 days) after the CreationDateTime to Authorize the Consent.
